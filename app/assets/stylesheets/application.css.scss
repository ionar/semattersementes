 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files

 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.

// Example using 'Cerulean' bootswatch

//Import bootstrap-sprockets
@import "bootstrap-sprockets";

// Import cerulean variables
@import "bootswatch/cosmo/variables";

// Then bootstrap itself
@import "bootstrap";

// Bootstrap body padding for fixed navbar
//body { padding-top: 60px; }

// And finally bootswatch style itself
@import "bootswatch/cosmo/bootswatch";
